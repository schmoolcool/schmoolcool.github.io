Safe Space
    Creating a Safe & Loving Space
    We kindly ask all of our guests to be mindful of their
    conversations throughout the celebration. Our wedding is a
    queer-friendly space, and it’s deeply important to us that
    everyone feels safe, seen, and comfortable. Out of respect for
    all who are attending, we ask that sensitive or potentially
    uncomfortable topics be avoided. We reserve the right to
    ask anyone who does not honor this request to leave.
    Thank you for helping us create a joyful and inclusive
    environment filled with love and respect.
